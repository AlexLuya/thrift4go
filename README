Add this git repository to your thrift checkout. It will overwrite a few files to add options for Go.

Currently generates code for the following protocols:
1) Binary Protocol (with test cases)
2) Fast Binary Protocol (with test cases)
3) Services (compiles, but never tested)
4) A (custom) simple JSON Protocol (with test cases)

Tested on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)

To install in your Go Repository do:
goinstall github.com/pomack/thrift4go/lib/go/thrift
goinstall -a -log
