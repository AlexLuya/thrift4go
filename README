Add this git repository to your thrift checkout. It will overwrite a few files to add options for Go.

Currently generates code for the following protocols:
1) Binary Protocol (with test cases)
2) Fast Binary Protocol (with test cases)
3) Services (compiles, but never tested)
4) A (custom) simple JSON Protocol

Tested on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)

Requires modifications to Go's src/pkg/bufio/bufio.go and src/pkg/bufio/bufio_test.go
bufio.go does not natively support incrementally reading and writing from the same buffer, which is necessary in the testcases provided.
The modifications are in the golang-src-modifications directory
